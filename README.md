# for_hopeless_men
for those who are hopeless like me and wanna make certain accomplishment 


This is a very personal topic, and I don't think most people need it, 

but then I thought that if I die early due to an accident or illness, it would be regrettable if I couldn't leave anything behind————

of course, I hope this project can help some people, and I also hope that no one needs this project.

这是一个很私人的话题，而且我觉得大多数人也不需要这个，

但是我转念一想，如果我因为意外或者疾病早死，无法留下些什么是很遗憾的————

当然希望这个项目可以帮助到一些人，同时也希望大家都不需要我这个项目（）

This project is for those who, like me, are in the valley of despair, but still want to achieve something. 

If the previous project was about the history of the future, then this project is an exploration of a possible solution based on history for the future...

In a sense, this can also be considered a 'two-way journey'

这个项目是给那些像我一样，身处绝望之谷，但又想成就些什么的人。

如果说之前那个项目，是未来的历史，那么这个项目就是基于历史，对于未来的一种可能的解决思路的探索……

某种程度上，这也算是“双向奔赴”了

The current simple plan is as follows: 

first, we need to have a certain foundation ————

this is for the freedom of thought, the freedom of practice, and enough free time ————

of course, for a person who is not needed in society, this is easily achievable.

目前简单的规划如下，

首先要有一定的基础————

这是为了思想的自由、实践的自由、以及足够的空余时间————

当然对于一个社会不需要的人来说，这个很容易做到。

The second step is to achieve a small success in our area of interest or expertise, in order to support us to enter a more creative environment.

第二步是在自己感兴趣或者擅长的领域取得一点小的成功，以支持我们去到一个更富有创造力的环境当中去

The third step is to gradually try to find systems that can protect ourselves, 

unite with more friends who hope for the development of civilization, 

and help people like us to participate in innovation and development.

第三步，我们要逐渐尝试去寻找一些可以保护自己的体系，

并且联合更多希望文明得到发展的朋友，

以及帮助一些像我们一样的人，参与到创新和发展当中来
